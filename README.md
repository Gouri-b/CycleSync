## Project Description
CycleSync is a cycle-aware productivity and wellness assistant that adapts task suggestions and calming activities based on the user’s mood and biological rhythm. It helps users plan their day in a way that matches their energy levels instead of forcing rigid schedules.

---

## The Problem Statement
Traditional productivity tools assume that users have the same energy, focus, and motivation every day. However, biological cycles—especially menstrual cycles—affect mood, concentration, and productivity. This mismatch causes stress, burnout, and unrealistic expectations.

---

## The Solution
CycleSync analyzes user inputs such as mood, pain level, and cycle day, and then:
- Suggests suitable tasks
- Recommends calming activities
- Provides breathing exercises and motivational quotes

This creates a gentle, adaptive productivity experience.
